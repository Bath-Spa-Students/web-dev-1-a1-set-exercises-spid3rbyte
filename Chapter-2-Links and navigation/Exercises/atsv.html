        <br> <b> This needs to be nominated for best picture! </b> <br>
        It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. <br>
        <br>I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away. <br> 
        Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. 
        <br>So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. <br>
        <br> Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. 
        <br>I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!

        <br> <b> My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching  </b><br> 
        
        <br> Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. <br>
        On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. 
        <br>Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. <br>
        I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.
