    <h2><i>method : </i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li> preheat the oven to 180°C (fan 160°C)/350°F/gas mark 4. grease a 20cm (8in) diameter deep cake tin with butter and line the base with baking paper.</li>

        <li> in a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. <br>sift the self-raising flour, plain flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda together, then stir the flour mixture and buttermilk, in alternating batches, into the butter mixture. stir in the food colouring.</br></li>

        <li> spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for 35–40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. <br>leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out on to a cooling rack to cool completely.</br> </li>

        <li> to make the filling, beat the cream cheese, sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth. put the 2 tablespoons water into a heatproof jug and add the gelatine.</li>

        <li>place the jug in a saucepan and add boiling water to come halfway up the side of the jug. <br>stir until the gelatine dissolves (if it seizes, stir gently over a low heat until it dissolves). </br>pour into the filling and beat until combined. whip the cream to soft peaks, then fold into the cream cheese mixture.</li>

        <li>cut the cooled cake in half horizontally and trim the top to level it, reserving the trimmings for decoration. <br>brush a 20cm (8in) diameter springform cake tin with oil. Line the base and sides with clingfilm, allowing it to overhang the sides. </br>put the cake base, cut side up, into the tin and spread with the filling. <br>sandwich together with the remaining cake. fold over the clingfilm and leave to set in the refrigerator overnight.</br></li>
        
        <li>To make the frosting, beat the cream cheese, butter, icing sugar and vanilla paste together in a bowl until well combined. Turn the cake out on to a serving plate and spread the frosting over the top and sides. Decorate with the reserved sponge crumbs.</li>
